# SandBoxied

SandBoxied is a fun project simulating a sandbox environment with various materials, heat, and pressure interactions

## Introduction

SandBoxied is a small project created for fun. It simulates a sandbox where users can place different materials and observe their interactions with heat and pressure

## Features

- Various materials with different properties
- Heat and pressure simulation
- Material interactions (melting, burning, etc.)
- Heat map visualization
- Intuitive user interface

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/SandBoxied.git
    cd SandBoxied
    ```

2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to start the simulation.

### Controls

- Use the menu on the left to select different materials.
- Click on the canvas to place the selected material.
- Use the heat and pressure tools to interact with the materials.

### Materials and Tools

- **Sand**: A granular material.
- **Water**: A fluid material.
- **Stone**: A solid material.
- **Wood**: A flammable material.
- **Iron**: A metal that absorbs heat and melts at high temperatures.
- **Fire**: A source of heat.
- **Heat**: Tool to increase temperature.
- **Pressure**: Tool to increase pressure.
